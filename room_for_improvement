This file is part of the documentation for the Python web_app application and
it will document some limitations as well as room for improvements. This was supposed
to be a complete web application that triggers and monitors python tests in the background.

1) The application lacks a front end. This is the main flaw.

2) The main application lacks tests. Should this be a production
product, tests should already have been implemented at this point.

3) In terms of code, the MVC model should have been used. This would probably be
the next step in the development process.

4) A table with the data of the tests needs to be implemented. Since the assignment
requires a front end interface, table in HTML was not created.

5) on web_app.py, a function to create and run the database straight from the
   application sould be implemented. Also, the database is implemented on memory.
   In a production environment, we should consider implement a real database on the server.
   Also, operations on the database such as delete and update were not implemented.

6) Some form to filter out (or sort) by user (requrester) and by successful/failed runs.
